Patch instructions for ikabot/command_line.py
=============================================

This file documents the minimal changes needed to add the Notification Setup
menu item to ikabot's command_line.py.

Only 3 changes are required:

--- CHANGE 1: Add import (near the other function imports at the top) ---

Add this line alongside the other "from ikabot.function..." imports:

    from ikabot.function.notificationSetup import notificationSetup

--- CHANGE 2: Add to menu_actions dict ---

Find the menu_actions dictionary and add this entry.
The 2109 prefix means: submenu 21 (Settings/Options), option 9.

    2109: notificationSetup,

--- CHANGE 3: Add menu option in the Settings submenu ---

Find the Settings/Options submenu section (where selected == 21).
It currently shows options like:

    print("(8) Load custom ikabot module")
    selected = read(min=0, max=8, digit=True)

Change to:

    print("(8) Load custom ikabot module")
    print("(9) Notification setup")
    selected = read(min=0, max=9, digit=True)

That's it! All existing functionality remains unchanged.
